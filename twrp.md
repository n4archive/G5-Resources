## What is wrong about the official TWRP?
It is 32 bit only, but all custom ROMs since Android 8 are 64 bit on this device.

## Where do I get an 64 bit TWRP?
I recommended to use JarlPenguin's TWRP. It is 64 bit, supports Treble and supports Encryption. You can download it [here](https://github.com/nift4/G5-Resources/releases/tag/twrp-jarlpenguin-3.3.1-3).
